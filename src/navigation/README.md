# Navigation

To add navigation to your app, install React Navigation:

```bash
npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/native-stack
npm install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
```

For iOS, also run:
```bash
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

Then create your navigation structure here.
